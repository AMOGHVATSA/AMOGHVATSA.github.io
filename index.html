      <p>India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world on the verge of becoming a global superpower. Europe is a major market for trading and business. To develop, India need the European Union’s help and European Union needs India’s help to stronger its hold on the Asian/Indian market. The current relations between EU and India are great. They have been great since 1994 after the Cooperation agreement. India is currently EU’s largest trade partner contributing to 12.5% of India’s overall trades between 2015 and 2016. India is one of the nations that have a surplus amount of trades with the EU. EU and India are not only major trading partners they have had major cooperations in nuclear energy, environment protection, maritime security, climate change just to name a few. Both the sides are also contributing to data protection and regulation,  India and EU have worked together in developing  ICT standardization  as well as having talks regarding ethnic use of AI and 5G. India had also helped EU with its satellite navigation system Galileo. The current conditions are indicating a bright future of India and EU relations. Once again I will repeat my statement the cooperation between EU and India is required for both of the parties to advance forward and considering the great business involvement and profitable trade this partnership is one to last.</p>
